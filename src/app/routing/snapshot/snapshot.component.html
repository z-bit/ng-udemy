<h3>Snapshot Component</h3>
<p>
  If the above ID changes and <b>Route with id</b> will be clicked the according parameter does
  not change as the child gained the parameter from a snapshot in the constructor:
</p>
<pre><code>this.id = activatedRoute.snapshot.params['id'];</code></pre>
<p>
  As the component still is displayed the constructor is not executed, no new snapshot.
  If you close the child with <b>Got it!</b> and call it again the changed parameter will be shown.
  A new snapshot is created.
</p>
<div class="ui blue inverted segment">Snapshot Component received parameter: {{id}}</div>
<br>
<button class="ui right floated button" (click)="onClick()">Got it!</button>
